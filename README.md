# 3D Game - Überkochen
Überkochen is a **couch co-op game** rooted in the source of all fun: chaos. 
You and your friends just finished your studies and decided to fulfill your dream of a startup restaurant. As every good student though you have miscalculated the time needed to built up a proper kitchen, as guests already demand food and drink. Finish orders, earn points and waste as little food as possible, as we want to keep our ecological footprint as small as possible.

With four different recipes to craft and meals to prepare, this game promises hectic in the kitchen. Try to hand in as many in the time you have.
Two available difficulties give the player the chance of an easy or tough start. And as both keyboard and controller are supported, no player has the excuse of "but the button didn't work".

We wish every player and tester a lot of fun!
